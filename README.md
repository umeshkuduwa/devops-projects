Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I'm a DevOps Engineer with extensive experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. Below you will find descriptions of some of the key projects I've worked on, along with the technologies and tools used.

Projects :

Project 1: Comprehensive DevOps Automation and Deployment (Capstone DevOps Project - 1)

Description:

This project aimed to streamline the deployment process of the production application by integrating several DevOps practices and tools. The key objectives and tasks included:

Dockerization of the Production Application: Containerized the existing application to ensure consistency across various environments and to simplify the deployment process.

Kubernetes Deployment: Deployed the Dockerized application on Kubernetes, leveraging its orchestration capabilities to manage and scale the application efficiently.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline with Jenkins: Set up a Jenkins freestyle pipeline that automatically deploys the latest version of the application whenever changes are detected in the GitHub repository.

Incorporated testing steps to verify the application's functionality on port 85 before proceeding with the deployment.

NodePort Service for Application Accessibility: Created a Jenkins pipeline to deploy the application on Kubernetes using a custom Docker image stored on Dockerhub.

Ensured the application is exposed as a NodePort Service for external accessibility.

Infrastructure Automation with Terraform: Automated the creation of necessary infrastructure resources using Terraform, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment setup.

Configuration Management with Ansible: Used Ansible to install Java on the required machines, streamlining the configuration management process and ensuring all dependencies are met.

This project significantly improved the deployment process's efficiency, reliability, and scalability, ultimately enhancing the overall productivity.

Technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub, NodePort and DockerHub.

Project 2: Robust and Secure Software Architecture Deployment (DevOps Capstone Project - 2)

Description:

As a Solutions Architect, I led a project to revamp the company's software architecture to enhance robustness and security. Key tasks included:

Regional Deployment: Deployed software in a US AWS region to meet regional requirements.

Private Instances: Ensured instances had no public IPs and no direct internet access for enhanced security.

Scalable Storage Solution: Implemented scalable storage to accommodate unpredictable space requirements.

Shared Storage: Set up real-time shared storage among servers.

Auto Scaling: Configured automatic scaling for CPU usage above 80%.

Managed Database: Migrated the database to a managed AWS service for improved fault tolerance.

Automated Deployment with CodeDeploy: Used CodeDeploy for automatic updates to the Auto Scaling Group.

Kubernetes Integration: Created a container from the GitHub Dockerfile and deployed it to an AWS Kubernetes cluster using a NodePort service for accessibility.

This project provided a secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture to meet the company's evolving needs.

Technologies: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Auto Scaling, CodeDeploy, Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub and NodePort.

Project 3: [Project Title]

Description: Brief description of the project, its objectives, and the technologies used.
